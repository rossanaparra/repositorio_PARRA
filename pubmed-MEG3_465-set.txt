TI  - MEG3: an Oncogenic Long Non-coding RNA in Different Cancers.
PG  - 859-874
LID - 10.1007/s12253-019-00614-3 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently considered as central regulators in 
      diverse biological processes and emerged as vital players controlling tumorigenesis. 
      Several lncRNAs can be classified into oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes 
      depending on their function in cancer. A maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) gene 
      transcripts a 1.6 kb lncRNA whose act as an antitumor component in different cancer 
      cells, such as breast, liver, glioma, colorectal, cervical, gastric, lung, ovarian 
      and osteosarcoma cancer cells. The present review highlights biological function of 
      MEG3 to repress tumor through regulating the major tumor suppressor genes p53 and 
      Rb, inhibiting angiogenesis-related factor, or controlling miRNAs. On the other 
      hand, previous studies have also suggested that MEG3 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT). However, deregulation of MEG3 is associated with the  development 
      and progression of cancer, suggesting that MEG3 may function as a potential 
      biomarker and therapeutic target for human cancers.

TI  - LncRNA Meg3 protects endothelial function by regulating the DNA damage response.
PG  - 1505-1522
LID - 10.1093/nar/gky1190 [doi]
AB  - The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating endothelial function 
      through the DNA damage response (DDR) remains poorly understood. In this study, we 
      demonstrate that lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (Meg3) interacts with the RNA 
      binding protein polypyrimidine tract binding protein 3 (PTBP3) to regulate gene 
      expression and endothelial function through p53 signaling ─ a major coordinator of 
      apoptosis and cell proliferation triggered by the DDR. Meg3 expression is induced in 
      endothelial cells (ECs) upon p53 activation. Meg3 silencing induces DNA damage, 
      activates p53 signaling, increases the expression of p53 target genes, promotes EC 
      apoptosis, and inhibits EC proliferation. Mechanistically, Meg3 silencing reduces 
      the interaction of p53 with Mdm2, induces p53 expression, and promotes the 
      association of p53 with the promoters of a subset of p53 target genes. PTBP3 
      silencing recapitulates the effects of Meg3 deficiency on the expression of p53 
      target genes, EC apoptosis and proliferation. The Meg3-dependent association of 
      PTBP3 with the promoters of p53 target genes suggests that Meg3 and PTBP3 restrain 
      p53 activation. Our studies reveal a novel role of Meg3 and PTBP3 in regulating p53 
      signaling and endothelial function, which may serve as novel targets for therapies 
      to restore endothelial homeostasis.

TI  - LncRNA MEG3 inhibits rheumatoid arthritis through miR-141 and inactivation of 
      AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.
PG  - 7116-7120
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.14591 [doi]
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammation mediated by autoimmune 
      responses. MEG3, a kind of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), participates in cell 
      proliferation in cancer tissues. However, the correlation between MEG3 and RA is yet 
      unclear. Therefore, to clarify how MEG3 works in RA, we performed a series of 
      experiments using RA samples. We found that MEG3 was downregulated in the 
      fibroblast-like synoviocytes of RA patients (RA-FLS), in comparison with healthy 
      subjects. MEG3 was also down-regulated evidently in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated 
      chondrocyte. As part of our experiments, MEG3 was overexpressed in chondrocyte by 
      transfection with lentivirus containing sequences encoding MEG3. In addition, in 
      presence of LPS, reductions were identified not only in the cell proliferation, but 
      also in the generation of interleukin-23 (IL-23), which, however were reversed in 
      the lentivirus (containing MEG3-encoding sequences)-transfected chondrocytes. 
      Up-regulated MEG3 resulted in an increase the level of Ki67. Moreover, MEG3 was 
      negatively correlated with miR-141, and miR-141 was up-regulated in LPS-treated 
      chondrocyte. Inhibitory effects of MEG3 overexpression, mentioned above, were 
      partially abolished by overexpressed miR-141. Further, animal experiment also showed 
      the inhibitory effect of MEG3 in overexpression on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. 
      In-vivoexperiments also showed that cell proliferation was facilitated by MEG3 
      overexpression with inhibited inflammation. In summary, the protective role of MEG3 
      in RA was proved to be exerted by the increase in the rate of proliferation, which 
      might correlate to the regulatory role of miR-141 and AKT/mTOR signal pathway, 
      suggesting that MEG3 holds great promise as a therapeutic strategy for RA.

AB  - Prolonged infection of uterine cervix epithelium with human papillomavirus (HPV) and 
      constitutive expression of viral oncogenes have been recognized as the main cause of 
      the complex molecular changes leading to transformation of cervical epithelial 
      cells. Deregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNA), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), 
      and circular RNAs (circRNA) is involved in the initiation and promotion processes of 
      cervical cancer development. Expression profiling of small RNAs in cervical 
      neoplasia revealed up-regulated "oncogenic" miRNAs, such as miR-10a, miR-21, miR-19, 
      and miR-146a, and down regulated "tumor suppressive" miRNAs, including miR-29a, 
      miR-372, miR-214, and miR-218, associated with cell growth, malignant 
      transformation, cell migration, and invasion. Also several lncRNAs, comprising among 
      others HOTAIR, MALAT1, GAS5, and MEG3, have shown to be associated with various 
      pathogenic processes such as tumor progression, invasion as well as therapeutic 
      resistance and emerged as new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cervical 
      cancer. Moreover, human genes encoded circular RNAs, such as has_circ-0018289, have 
      shown to sponge specific miRNAs and to concur to the deregulation of target genes. 
      Viral encoded circE7 has also demonstrated to overexpress E7 oncoprotein thus 
      contributing to cell transformation. In this review, we summarize current literature 
      on the complex interplay between miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs and their role in 
      cervical neoplasia.

TI  - Non-Coding RNAs in Breast Cancer: Intracellular and Intercellular Communication.
LID - 10.3390/ncrna4040040 [doi]
LID - 40
AB  - Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are regulators of intracellular and intercellular signaling 
      in breast cancer. ncRNAs modulate intracellular signaling to control diverse 
      cellular processes, including levels and activity of estrogen receptor α (ERα), 
      proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis, and stemness. In addition, ncRNAs can 
      be packaged into exosomes to provide intercellular communication by the transmission 
      of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to cells locally or 
      systemically. This review provides an overview of the biogenesis and roles of 
      ncRNAs: small nucleolar RNA (snRNA), circular RNAs (circRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs 
      (piRNAs), miRNAs, and lncRNAs in breast cancer. Since more is known about the miRNAs 
      and lncRNAs that are expressed in breast tumors, their established targets as 
      oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors will be reviewed. The focus is on miRNAs and 
      lncRNAs identified in breast tumors, since a number of ncRNAs identified in breast 
      cancer cells are not dysregulated in breast tumors. The identity and putative 
      function of selected lncRNAs increased: nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 
      (NEAT1), metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), steroid 
      receptor RNA activator 1 (SRA1), colon cancer associated transcript 2 (CCAT2), 
      colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE), myocardial infarction 
      associated transcript (MIAT), and long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, Regulator 
      of Reprogramming (LINC-ROR); and decreased levels of maternally-expressed 3 (MEG3) 
      in breast tumors have been observed as well. miRNAs and lncRNAs are considered 
      targets of therapeutic intervention in breast cancer, but further work is needed to 
      bring the promise of regulating their activities to clinical use.

TI  - MEG3 regulates apoptosis of adipose‑derived stem cells.
PG  - 2435-2442
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2020.11059 [doi]
AB  - In plastic surgery, the maneuverability and safety of autologous fat transplantation 
      have become increasingly recognized and continuously improved. However, the 
      uncertainty of adipocyte survival makes it difficult to predict postoperative 
      effects. Adipose‑derived stem cells (ADSCs) exhibit remarkable paracrine activity, 
      and the number of ADSCs in adipose tissue is closely related to tissue survival. 
      Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is known to modulate the apoptosis of various 
      cell types. The present study aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that MEG3 serves an 
      important role in ADSC apoptosis by regulating the expression of p53, and to explore 
      the regulatory mechanisms of p53 in ADSC apoptosis. MEG3 was overexpressed in ADSCs 
      and these cells were evaluated for viability, TP53 expression, apoptosis, 
      morphology, and Bax and Bcl‑2 expression by performing MTT assays, reverse 
      transcription‑quantitative PCR, flow cytometry analysis and western blotting. This 
      study demonstrated that MEG3 may have an important role in the spontaneous apoptosis 
      of ADSCs, and apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. In addition, this study 
      revealed that p53 had a regulatory role in the downstream Bcl‑2/Bax pathway. This 
      study provides insight into the role of MEG3 in ADSC apoptosis, thereby facilitating 
      the survival of ADSCs during adipose tissue transplantation. Further in vivo and 
      in vitro experiments should be conducted, along with the development of clinical 
      applications.

TI  - LncRNA meg3 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and vivo studies.
PG  - 4089-4099
AB  - Although abnormal expression of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MEG3 has been 
      reported in multiple cancer types, the role of MEG3 in the pathobiology of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. This study evaluated the expression 
      of lncRNA MEG3 and a microRNA (miRNA-10a-5p) implicated in HCC metastasis in cancer 
      and carcinoma adjacent tissues of HCC samples (n=30 each) via in situ hybridization 
      and quantitative RT-PCR. The effects of overexpressing either MEG3 alone, or MEG3 in 
      combination with miRNA-10a-5p, on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle 
      progression, migration, and invasion of HepG2 cells were evaluated using functional 
      assays. Dual luciferase reporter assays and western blotting were employed to 
      delineate the mechanisms of MEG3 and miRNA-10a-5p regulation of key oncogenes and 
      tumor suppressors in HCC cells. Compared to carcinoma-adjacent regions, MEG3 
      expression was downregulated in cancer regions of HCC samples; by contrast, 
      miRNA-10a-5p was overexpressed in cancer regions compared to tumor-adjacent areas. 
      Furthermore, overexpression of MEG3 (a) decreased proliferation, migration, and 
      invasion of HepG2 cells; (b) enhanced apoptosis and the proportion of HepG2 cells in 
      G1 of the cell cycle; (c) increased the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog 
      (PTEN), Bcl2-associated X (Bax), and p53 proteins; and (d) decreased the expression 
      of miRNA-10a-5p, AKT, p-AKT, Bcl-2, and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-2 and 
      -9. Furthermore, miRNA-10a-5p bound the 3-untranslated region of PTEN mRNA and 
      downregulated PTEN protein expression. Taken together, these data suggest that MEG3 
      regulates the PTEN/AKT/MMP-2/MMP-9 signaling axis and contributes to HCC development 
      by targeting miRNA-10a-5p.

TI  - MEG3 promotes liver cancer by activating PI3K/AKT pathway through regulating AP1G1.
PG  - 1459-1467
LID - 17103 [pii]
LID - 10.26355/eurrev_201902_17103 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the biological function of maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in liver cancer and the potential mechanism of 
      phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway in regulating 
      proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative 
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to examine the level of 
      MEG3 in 72 pairs of liver cancer tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues. 
      Expression levels of MEG3 and AP1G1 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines including 
      SMMC-7721 and BEL-7402 were detected. After transfection of MEG3-siRNA or AP1G1 
      overexpression plasmid, the proliferative and invasive abilities of hepatoma cells 
      were detected through cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and cell invasion assay. The 
      effects of MEG3 and AP1G1 on the cell cycle of hepatoma cell lines were examined 
      using flow cytometry. Western blot was conducted to estimate the changes in the 
      protein levels of AP1G1, p-PI3K, p-AKT and VEGF before and after transfection. 
      RESULTS: The level of MEG3 in hepatoma cancer tissues and cell lines was 
      significantly reduced, especially in patients with advanced liver cancer. Knockdown 
      of MEG3 significantly promoted proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells, but 
      accelerated cell cycle. Western blot analysis revealed that knockdown of MEG3 
      reduced the level of AP1G1 and activated the PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, rescue 
      experiments demonstrated that overexpression of AP1G1 partially reversed the 
      promotive effect of lowly-expressed MEG3 on cell proliferation and invasion, 
      suggesting that low expression of MEG3 may activate PI3K/AKT pathway by inhibiting 
      AP1G1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Low expression of MEG3 could promote the 
      proliferative and invasive abilities of hepatoma cells and accelerate cell cycle. 
      The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of AP1G1 expression and activation of 
      PI3K/AKT pathway.

AB  - Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located on 
      chromosome 14q32.3. Direct sequencing experiments have shown monoallelic expression 
      of this lncRNA. Several studies have shown down-regulation of this lncRNA in human 
      cancers. In some cases, hypermethylation of the promoter region has been suggested 
      as the underlying mechanism. Functional studies have shown that this lncRNA controls 
      expression of several tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes among them are p53, RB, 
      MYC and TGF-β. Through regulation of Wnt-β-catenin pathway, it also affects 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In vitro studies have demonstrated contribution 
      of MEG3 in defining response to chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel, 
      cisplatin and oxaliplatin. Certain polymorphisms within MEG3 are implicated in 
      cancer risk (rs7158663, rs4081134 and rs11160608) or therapeutic response of cancer 
      patients (rs10132552). Taken together, this lncRNA is regarded as a putative cancer 
      biomarker and treatment target. In the current review, several aspects of the 
      participation of MEG3 in carcinogenesis are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of maternally-expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in fetal 
      endothelial dysfunction induced by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and its 
      underlying mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
      (HUVECs) were extracted from GDM pregnancies and normal pregnancies. Cell 
      proliferation, apoptosis, migration and angiogenesis of HUVECs were detected by cell 
      counting kit-8 (CCK-8), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), wound healing and 
      tube formation assay, respectively. MEG3 expressions in HUVECs extracted from 16 GDM 
      pregnancies and 18 normal pregnancies were detected by quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Besides, angiogenesis and MEG3 expression in 
      HUVECs treated with glucose were detected, respectively. Proliferation, apoptosis, 
      migration and angiogenesis were also detected after HUVECs were transfected with 
      MEG3 lentivirus. Target genes of MEG3 were predicted by bioinformatics method and 
      further verified by luciferase reporter gene assay. The protein expression of 
      possible signaling pathway was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: HUVEC cells 
      extracted from GDM pregnancies presented increased apoptosis and decreased 
      proliferation, migration and angiogenesis compared with those from healthy 
      pregnancies. Meanwhile, MEG3 was overexpressed in HUVECs extracted from GDM 
      pregnancies compared with that of healthy pregnancies. High dose of glucose 
      treatment led to reduced angiogenesis and elevated MEG3 expression in HUVECs. MEG3 
      overexpression further promoted apoptosis, but inhibited proliferation, migration 
      and angiogenesis of HUVECs. By bioinformatics and luciferase reporter gene assay, 
      microRNA-370-3p was found to be the target gene of MEG3 and directly targeted on 
      AFF1. Moreover, MEG3 overexpression led to downregulated microRNA-370-3p and 
      upregulated AFF1 mainly through inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway. CONCLUSIONS: MEG3 is 
      overexpressed in HUVECs extracted from GDM pregnancies. MEG3 damages fetal 
      endothelial function through targeting microRNA-370-3p and AFF1 via PI3K/AKT 
      pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND This study was designed to illustrate the effects and latent mechanism of 
      lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced 
      brain injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS An ICH rat model was generated to determine the 
      role of lncRNA MEG3 in ICH. The interaction between lncRNA MEG3 and microRNA 
      (miR)-181b were confirmed by Starbase and dual-luciferase reporter assay. One hour 
      (h) or 3 days after ICH stimulation, rat neurological injury was evaluated by 
      modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS). Brain water content and cell apoptosis 
      were assessed using brain edema assessment and ﬂow cytometry (FCM), respectively. 
      Caspase3 activity was also determined. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was 
      applied to evaluate the levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines. Moreover, the 
      representative biomarkers of oxidative stress were evidenced using detection kits. 
      RESULTS The lncRNA MEG3 level in ICH rat brain tissues was higher than that in the 
      sham group. miR-181b was a direct target of lncRNA MEG3 and it was downregulated in 
      brain tissues of ICH rats. Notably, we found that neurobehavioral scores, brain 
      water content, and neuronal apoptosis were decreased and caspase3 activity was 
      reduced in MEG3-shRNA-treated ICH rats, while we observed the opposite result in 
      ICH+MEG3-shRNA+miR-181b inhibitor rats. Further analyses revealed that MEG3-shRNA 
      inhibited inflammatory cytokines release and reduced oxidative stress. All these 
      results were reversed by miR-181b inhibitor. In addition, MEG3-shRNA activated the 
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, which was 
      reversed by miR-181b inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS MEG3-shRNA restrained oxidative stress 
      and inflammation following ICH in an miR-181b-dependent manner.

AB  - Osteosarcoma is known as a malignant tumour with a high mortality rate in 
      orthopaedic settings; however, the factors associated with its degree of malignancy 
      and the biological response remains to be elucidated. Although the essential role of 
      the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) has been recently 
      reported, its biological functions and regulatory mechanism in osteosarcoma cells 
      have not yet been reported. In the present study, reverse transcription-quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of MEG3 in MG63 
      cells was lower compared with in hFOB1.19 cells. Furthermore, it was observed that 
      overexpressing MEG3 in MG63 cells resulted in a decline in the proliferation and 
      invasion, and a marked increase in apoptosis. Additionally, western blotting was 
      used to detect the changes in expression of p53 and MDM2 proto-oncogene, which may 
      be regulated by MEG3, and proteins that associated with cell proliferation, invasion 
      and apoptosis. It was demonstrated that the upregulation of MEG3 significantly 
      increased the transactivation of p53 and induced downstream changes in protein 
      expression. In conclusion, these experiments have demonstrated that MEG3 serves an 
      essential regulatory role in the biological processes of human osteosarcoma cells, 
      and imply that MEG3 may be a marker for predicting the occurrence and development of 
      osteosarcoma.

TI  - c-MYC-induced long noncoding RNA MEG3 aggravates kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury 
      through activating mitophagy by upregulation of RTKN to trigger the Wnt/β-catenin 
      pathway.

AB  - Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a 
      life-threatening disease. The activation of mitophagy was previously identified to 
      play an important role in IRI. Maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) can promote cerebral 
      IRI and hepatic IRI. The present study was designed to study the role of MEG3 in 
      renal IRI. Renal IRI mice models were established, and HK-2 cells were used to 
      construct the in vitro models of IRI. Hematoxylin-eosin staining assay was applied 
      to reveal IRI-triggered tubular injury. MitoTracker Green FM staining and an ALP kit 
      were employed for detection of mitophagy. TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling 
      assay was used to reveal cell apoptosis. The results showed that renal cortex of IRI 
      mice contained higher expression of MEG3 than that of sham mice. MEG3 expression was 
      also elevated in HK-2 cells following IRI, suggesting that MEG3 might participate in 
      the development of IRI. Moreover, downregulation of MEG3 inhibited the apoptosis of 
      HK-2 cells after IRI. Mitophagy was activated by IRI, and the inhibition of MEG3 can 
      restore mitophagy activity in IRI-treated HK-2 cells. Mechanistically, we found that 
      MEG3 can bind with miR-145-5p in IRI-treated cells. In addition, rhotekin (RTKN) was 
      verified to serve as a target of miR-145-5p. MEG3 upregulated RTKN expression by 
      binding with miR-145-5p. Further, MEG3 activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by 
      upregulation of RTKN. The downstream effector of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, c-MYC, 
      served as the transcription factor to activate MEG3. In conclusion, the positive 
      feedback loop of MEG3/miR-145-5p/RTKN/Wnt/β-catenin/c-MYC promotes renal IRI by 
      activating mitophagy and inducing apoptosis, which might offer a new insight into 
      the therapeutic methods for renal IRI in the future.

TI  - lncRNA MEG3 Suppresses the Tumorigenesis of Hemangioma by Sponging miR-494 and

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dysregulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is associated with 
      the proliferation and metastasis in a variety of cancers, of which lncRNA maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (MEG3) has been indicated as a tumor suppressor in multiple 
      malignancies. However, the underlying mechanisms by which MEG3 contributes to human 
      hemangiomas (HAs) remain undetermined. METHODS: qRT-PCR analysis was performed to 
      examine the expression levels of MEG3 and VEGF in proliferating or involuting phase 
      HAs. MTT, colony formation assay, flow cytometry analysis and a subcutaneous 
      xenograft tumor model were conducted to assess the effects of MEG3 on the HAs 
      tumorigenesis. The interaction between MEG3 and miRNAs or their downstream pathways 
      was evidenced by bioinformatic analysis, luciferase report assays, RNA 
      immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The expression 
      of MEG3 was substantially decreased and had a negative correlation with VEGF 
      expression in proliferating phase HAs, as compared with the involuting phase HAs and 
      normal skin tissues. Ectopic expression of MEG3 suppressed cell proliferation, 
      colony formation and induced cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo, followed by the 
      downregulation of VEGF and cyclinD1, but knockdown of MEG3 reversed these effects. 
      Furthermore, MEG3 was verified to act as a sponge of miR-494 in HAs cells, and 
      miR-494 counteracted MEG3-caused anti-proliferative effects by regulating 
      PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, and exhibited the negative correlation with MEG3 and PTEN 
      expression in proliferating phase HAs. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that 
      lncRNA MEG3 inhibited HAs tumorigenesis by sponging miR-494 and regulating 
      PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway.

TI  - Long noncoding RNA Meg3 sponges miR-708 to inhibit intestinal tumorigenesis via 
      SOCS3-repressed cancer stem cells growth.
PG  - 25

LID - 25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the most common gastrointestinal cancer 
      and a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with most showing pathologies 
      indicating the malignant transformation of early stage intestinal stem cells. The 
      long non-coding RNA Meg3, which functions as a tumor suppressor, has been reported 
      to be abnormal in multiple tumorigenesis events; however, the underlying mechanism 
      by which Meg3 contributes to the malignant proliferation of colonic stem cells 
      remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed the expression levels of Meg3, miR-708, and 
      SOCS3 in samples from Apc loss-of-function (Apc(min)) mice and patients with CRC, 
      particularly in colonic crypt cells. Apc(min) mice and AMO/DSS-induced mice model 
      (in vivo) and organoid culture system (in vitro) were used to explore the effect of 
      the Meg3/miR-708/SOCS3 axis on tumorigenesis in the colon. In vitro, we performed 
      RNApull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays using DLD1 and 
      RKO cell lines. FINDINGS: The Meg3/miR-708/SOCS3 signaling axis plays a critical 
      role in the early stage of CRC development. Our data showed Meg3 levels negatively 
      correlate with miR-708 levels both in clinical samples and in the Apc(min) mouse 
      model, which indicated that Meg3 acts as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of 
      miR-708. Then, miR-708 served as an oncogene, inducing neoplasia in both Apc(min) 
      mice and cultured colonic organoids. Put together, miR-708 appears to promote 
      malignant proliferation of colonic stem cells by targeting SOCS3/STAT3 signaling. 
      INTERPRETATION: These data revealed that Meg3 sponges miR-708 to inhibit CRC 
      development via SOCS3-mediated repression of the malignant proliferation of colonic 
      stem cells. The Meg3/miR-708/SOCS3 signaling axis provides potential targets for the 
      diagnosis and treatment of CRC, particularly early stage CRC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent malignancy and has 
      the fourth highest global cancer mortality rate. Early diagnosis and prompt medical 
      attention can improve quality of life and the prognosis of CRC patients. 
      Accumulating evidence reveals that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as 
      oncogenes or anti-oncogenes, as well as biomarkers in various cancers. AIM: To 
      investigate the levels and molecular mechanism of the lncRNA maternally expressed 
      gene 3 (MEG3) in CRC. METHODS: The levels of lncRNA MEG3 in CRC tissue, serum and 
      cell line samples were explored via qRT-PCR. The relationship between MEG3 levels 
      and clinicopathological features in CRC was investigated. The diagnostic and 
      prognostic values of serum MEG3 levels were analyzed with ROC curves and 
      Kaplan‑Meier survival curves, respectively. RESULTS: Significant decreased levels of 
      MEG3 existed in CRC tissue, cell lines and serum. CRC patients with down-regulated 
      serum MEG3 levels had larger tumor sizes, and advanced clinical stages. The 
      sensitivity and specificity of serum MEG3 levels in CRC detection was 0.667 and 
      0.875, respectively. Tumor size, T stages, and serum MEG3 levels are indie factors 
      that produce an effect on CRC patients' prognosis. Kaplan‑Meier survival curves 
      suggested that CRC patients with high levels of MEG3 had a remarkably better overall 
      survival rate. CONCLUSION: LncRNA MEG3 is down-regulated in CRC, and regulates cell 
      functions by targeting adenosine deaminase's effect on RNA 1 in CRC.

TI  - LncRNAs: Novel Biomarkers for Pancreatic Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/biom11111665 [doi]
LID - 1665
AB  - Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly neoplasms and the seventh major cause of 
      cancer-related deaths among both males and females. This cancer has a poor prognosis 
      due to the lack of appropriate methods for early detection of cancer. Long 
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recently found to influence the progression and 
      initiation of pancreatic cancer. MACC1-AS1, LINC00976, LINC00462, LINC01559, 
      HOXA-AS2, LINC00152, TP73-AS1, XIST, SNHG12, LUCAT1, and UCA1 are among the 
      oncogenic lncRNAs in pancreatic cancer. On the other hand, LINC01111, LINC01963, 
      DGCR5, MEG3, GAS5, and LINC00261 are among tumor suppressor lncRNAs in this tissue. 
      In the current review, we summarize the roles of these two classes of lncRNAs in 
      pancreatic cancer and discuss their potential as attractive diagnostic and 
      prognostic biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. We also identified that the low 
      expression of MEG3, LINC01963, and LINC00261 and the high expression of MACC1-AS1, 
      LINC00462, LINC01559, and UCA1 were significantly correlated with worse survival in 
      pancreatic cancer patients. Further research on these lncRNAs will provide new clues 
      that could potentially improve the early diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and 
      personalized treatments of patients with pancreatic cancer.

      regulating LAMA4 expression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OC) is a common female reproductive malignancy with a 
      high mortality rate. Although LAMA4 was observed to be downregulated in OC cells, 
      its mechanism in regulating OC metastasis is still unknown. This study aimed to 
      investigate the effect of LAMA4 and its mechanism on OC. METHODS: To achieve this 
      aim, a microarray analysis was performed to screen out the key genes involved in OC 
      pathogenesis. Western-blot and qRT-PCR assays were also carried out to detect 
      protein and mRNA expressions, respectively. A luciferase reporter assay was further 
      used to confirm the direct interaction of miR-30e-3p with MEG3, and the direct 
      interaction of miR-30e-3p with LAMA4 mRNA. Cytological experiments (CCK8, colony 
      formation assay, wound-healing assay etc.) were then performed to explore the roles 
      of miR-30e-3p, MEG3, and LAMA4 in OC cells. RESULTS: After carrying out microarray 
      analysis, LAMA4 was confirmed as a key gene associated with OC pathogenesis. 
      Research results proved that miR-30e-3p was markedly upregulated, while MEG3 and 
      LAMA4 were noticeably downregulated in OC tissues and cells. The overexpression of 
      LAMA4 significantly impaired the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells. 
      However, the upregulation of MEG3 increased the expression of LAMA4 by sponging 
      miR-30e-3p, which alleviated the malignancy of OC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Observations 
      showed that forced LAMA4 overexpression could inhibit OC progression, which was 
      regulated by MEG3 via sponging miR-30e-3p. The findings of this research could 
      provide new insights into the mechanism by which MEG3 and LAMA4 exert their 
      anti-oncogenic roles in OC progression.Trial registration Not applicable.

TI  - High expression of lncRNA MEG3 participates in non-small cell lung cancer by 
      regulating microRNA-7-5p.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was made to investigate whether long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) 
      MEG3 could participate in the occurrence and development of non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC) by regulating the expression of BRCA1 through competitive binding to 
      microRNA-7-5p. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain 
      Reaction (qRT-PCR) to explore the expression of lncRNA MEG3 and BRCA1 in NSCLC 
      tissues and adjacent normal tissues, as well as NSCLC cell lines. The dual 
      luciferase reporter gene assay was used to detect the binding of microRNA-7-5p to 
      lncRNA MEG3 and BRCA1. Meanwhile, the expression of BRCA1, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) 
      and BCL2-associated X (Bax) was detected by Western blot after the cells were 
      overexpressed or knocked down of lncRNA MEG3. All these experiments were designed to 
      investigate whether lncRNA MEG3 participated in the pathogenesis of NSCLC through 
      inhibiting the expression of BRCA1 and Bcl-2 and promoting Bax expression. RESULTS: 
      The expressions of lncRNA MEG3 and BRCA1 in NSCLC tissues and A549 and HCC823 cell 
      lines were significantly lower than those in the normal group. Overexpression of 
      lncRNA MEG3 and BRCA1 in A549 and HCC823 cell lines resulted in increased apoptosis 
      of lung cancer cells. Dual luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that lncRNA MEG3 
      can regulate the expression of BRCA1 through competitively binding to microRNA-7-5p 
      to form the lncRNA MEG3/microRNA-7-5p/BRCA1 regulatory network. Besides, lncRNA MEG3 
      could inhibit the apoptosis inhibitory protein Bcl-2 and promote the expression of 
      apoptosis-promoting factor Bax. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA MEG3 was significantly 
      downregulated in NSCLC, and it could regulate the BRCA1 expression by competitive 
      binding to microRNA-7-5p.

TI  - LncRNA MEG3 suppresses migration and promotes apoptosis by sponging miR-548d-3p to 
      modulate JAK-STAT pathway in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 882-890
LID - 10.1002/iub.2012 [doi]
AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a lethal malignancy and its prognosis remains 
      dismal. Thus, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms is needed to provide a new 
      insight for new therapies. It has been reported that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) 
      maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) was downregulated in OSCC tissues, however, its 
      functional mechanism remains uncertain. Here, we found that the overexpression of 
      MEG3 suppressed migration and promoted apoptosis in OSCC cell lines, while 
      inhibition of MEG3 exhibited opposite effect. We also found that MEG3 could 
      effectively sponge miR-548d-3p and decrease its expression level. Moreover, 
      miR-548d-3p repressed the expression of SOCS5 and SOCS6 through binding their 3'UTR, 
      thereby modulating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and functioning as an oncogene in 
      OSCC cells. Importantly, overexpression of MEG3 enhanced the expression of SOCS5 and 
      SOCS6 to regulate JAK-STAT pathway, whereas miR-548d-3p overexpression decreased the 
      effects of MEG3 on levels of SOCS5/SOCS6. Furthermore, upregulated expression of 
      miR-548d-3p could abrogate the effect of MEG3 overexpression on migration and 
      apoptosis in OSCC cell lines. In addition, the overexpression of MEG3 inhibited 
      tumor migration and facilitated apoptosis in vivo. Together, our results revealed 
      that MEG3 could modulate JAK-STAT pathway via miR-548d-3p/SOCS5/SOCS6 to suppresses 
      migration and promote apoptosis in OSCC. Our research indexed a new functional 
      mechanism of MEG3 in OSCC, and this mechanism may be a potential prognostic factor 
      and therapeutic target. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 2019.

TI  - Long noncoding RNA NEAT1 drives aggressive endometrial cancer progression via 
      miR-361-regulated networks involving STAT3 and tumor microenvironment-related genes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High-grade endometrioid and serous endometrial cancers (ECs) are an 
      aggressive subtype of ECs without effective therapies. The reciprocal communication 
      between tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment drives tumor progression. 
      Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key mediators of tumorigenesis and metastasis. 
      However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in aggressive EC progression and 
      tumor microenvironment remodeling. METHODS: We performed an array-based lncRNA 
      analysis of a parental HEC-50 EC cell population and derivatives with highly 
      invasive, sphere-forming, and paclitaxel (TX)-resistant characteristics. We 
      characterized the roles of the lncRNA NEAT1 in mediating aggressive EC progression 
      in vitro and in vivo and explored the molecular events downstream of NEAT1. RESULTS: 
      We identified 10 lncRNAs with upregulated expression (NEAT1, H19, PVT1, UCA1, 
      MIR7-3HG, SNHG16, HULC, RMST, BCAR4 and LINC00152) and 10 lncRNAs with downregulated 
      expression (MEG3, GAS5, DIO3OS, MIR155HG, LINC00261, FENDRR, MIAT, TMEM161B-AS1, 
      HAND2-AS1 and NBR2) in the highly invasive, sphere-forming and TX-resistant 
      derivatives. NEAT1 expression was markedly upregulated in early-stage EC tissue 
      samples, and high NEAT1 expression predicted a poor prognosis. Inhibiting NEAT1 
      expression with small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) diminished cellular proliferation, 
      invasion, sphere formation, and xenograft tumor growth and improved TX response in 
      aggressive EC cells. We showed that NEAT1 functions as an oncogenic sponge for the 
      tumor suppressor microRNA-361 (miR-361), which suppresses proliferation, invasion, 
      sphere formation and TX resistance by directly targeting the oncogene STAT3. 
      Furthermore, miR-361 also suppressed the expression of multiple prometastatic genes 
      and tumor microenvironment-related genes, including MEF2D, ROCK1, WNT7A, VEGF-A, 
      PDE4B, and KPNA4. CONCLUSIONS: NEAT1 initiates a miR-361-mediated network to drive 
      aggressive EC progression. These data support a rationale for inhibiting NEAT1 
      signaling as a potential therapeutic strategy for overcoming aggressive EC 
      progression and chemoresistance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of LncRNA MEG3 in the subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) 
      and its underlying mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expressions of lncRNA MEG3 
      in SAH patients and animal model were detected by quantitative real-time PCR 
      (qRT-PCR). After LncRNA MEG3 was overexpressed in neurons by lentivirus, viability 
      and apoptosis abilities were detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow 
      cytometry, and TUNEL assay, respectively. The apoptosis-related genes and Pi3k/Akt 
      pathway-related proteins were further detected by a Western blot. RESULTS: The 
      expressions of lncRNA MEG3 in SAH patients were remarkably higher than normal 
      controls, which were positively correlated with SAH severity. After lncRNA MEG3 
      overexpression, neuronal cell activity was decreased and cell apoptosis was 
      increased. Moreover, the expressions of Bax, p53, and cleaved Caspase-3 were 
      increased, whereas the expression of Bcl-2 and Pi3k/Akt pathway-related proteins 
      were decreased after lncRNA MEG3 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA MEG3 is 
      up-regulated in SAH, which may promote SAH-induced neuronal cell injury via 
      inhibition of the Pi3k/Akt pathway.

TI  - LncRNA HLA-F-AS1 Enhances the Migration, Invasion and Apoptosis of Glioblastoma 
      Cells by Targeting lncRNA MEG3.
PG  - 9139-9145
LID - 10.2147/CMAR.S322351 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies revealed the oncogenic role of long non-coding RNA 
      (lncRNA) HLA-F-AS1 in colon cancer and breast cancer, while its role in other 
      cancers is unclear. We predicted the direct interaction between HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3, 
      which is a tumor suppressor lncRNA. We then assessed the interaction between 
      HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3 in glioblastoma (GBM). METHODS: The expression levels of 
      HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3 in GBM and paired non-tumor tissues from 60 GBM patients were 
      analyzed by RT-qPCR. Overexpression of HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3 was achieved in GBM cells 
      to explore the interaction between them. The direct interaction between them was 
      confirmed by RNA pull-down assay. The roles of HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3 in cell invasion, 
      migration and apoptosis were explored by Transwell assays and cell apoptosis assay. 
      RESULTS: HLA-F-AS1 was highly expressed, and MEG3 was downregulated in GBM. 
      Overexpression of HLA-F-AS1 reduced the expression levels of MEG3 while 
      overexpression of MEG3 did not alter the expression of HLA-F-AS1. HLA-F-AS1 
      increased cell migration and invasion, but decreased cell apoptosis. MEG3 played 
      opposite roles and reduced the effects of HLA-F-AS1 on cell behaviors. CONCLUSION: 
      HLA-F-AS1 may sponge MEG3 in GBM cells to promote cell invasion and migration, and 
      to suppress cell apoptosis.

TI  - MEG3 Suppresses Human Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Cells Growth and Metastasis by 
      Down-Regulation of Mir-183.
PG  - 345-356
LID - 10.1159/000484906 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are rare neoplasms which 
      arise from pancreatic islet cells. Recently, lncRNA MEG3 has been reported as a 
      tumor suppressor in variety cancers. This study aimed to reveal the functional 
      effects of MEG3 on pNETs which has not been uncovered previously. METHODS: The 
      expression of MEG3, miR-183, and BRI3 in BON1 cells were altered by transfection 
      with their specific vectors/shRNA, or mimic/inhibitor. Thereafter, cell viability, 
      apoptosis, the protein expressions of cell cycle related factors, and apoptosis 
      associated factors, as well as cell migration and invasion were respectively 
      assessed by typan blue staining, flow cytometry, western blotting, and transwell 
      assay. RESULTS: MEG3 was low expressed in BON1 and QGP-1 cells, when compared to 
      three normal cell lines (HEK293, CCL-153, and EC-304). MEG3 overexpression decreased 
      BON1 cells viability, invasion, migration, but significantly induced apoptosis. 
      miR-183 was a direct target of MEG3, and miR-183 up-regulation abolished the 
      anti-growth and anti-metastasis effects of MEG3 overexpression on BON1 cells. 
      Moreover, BRI3 was a target of miR-183, and BRI3 exhibited a tumor-promoting role 
      possibly via activation of p38/ERK/AKT and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in BON1 cells. 
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a tumor suppressive effect of MEG3 in BON1 cells 
      that suppresses tumor cells growth and metastasis. A novel regulatory mechanism has 
      been revealed that modulation of MEG3/miR-183/BRI3 axis may be pivotal in pNET.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present work was to investigate the effects and mechanisms 
      of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in cardiomyocytes 
      injury and apoptosis induced by high glucose (HG) in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      HG-induced rats' cardiomyocytes with si-MEG3 transfection were constructed. Cell 
      viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level were examined using the MTT 
      (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) and LDH assay kits, 
      respectively. Cardiomyocytes apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
      transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The expressions 
      of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3 proteins were determined by 
      Western blot. The expression of lncRNA MEG3 was measured by Reverse 
      Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Our results indicated 
      that the expression of MEG3 was significantly upregulated in HG-treated 
      cardiomyocytes. The downregulation of MEG3 could attenuate cardiomyocytes injury and 
      apoptosis by decreasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3 
      expression. CONCLUSIONS: The downregulation of MEG3 could attenuate cardiomyocytes 
      injury and apoptosis induced by HG. The molecular mechanism was associated with the 
      inhibition of the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway.

TI  - MEG3 is associated with gsp oncogene regulation of growth hormone hypersecretion, 
      proliferation and invasiveness of human GH-secreting adenomas.

AB  - Overactivation of the Gs-mediated pathway by mutations of the G-protein α subunit 
      (Gsα), a gsp oncogene, results in increased growth hormone (GH) hypersecretion and 
      reduced tumor volume in patients with GH-secreting pituitary tumors. However, the 
      mechanism underlying the clinical characteristics of gsp oncogene requires further 
      investigation. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element binding (CREB), as 
      a downstream target gene of gsp oncogene, is implicated in activating maternally 
      expressed gene 3 (MEG3). The present study proposes that gsp oncogene mediates 
      MEG3-regulating GH hypersecretion, resulting in the small tumor size of GH-secreting 
      tumors. Therefore, the present study detected Gsα mutations by polymerase chain 
      reaction in GH-secreting tumors, and revealed that Gsα mutations were observed in 
      7/25 (28%) GH-secreting tumors. Gsp-positive tumors indicated significantly 
      increased levels of phosphorylated p-CREB (P<0.0001) and MEG3 (P=0.039), compared 
      with gsp-negative tumors. The results indicated that MEG3 levels were positively 
      correlated with GH and IGF-1 levels, and negatively correlated with the tumor volume 
      of GH-secreting tumors. The group with gsp-positive or with high MEG3 expression 
      indicated a significantly reduced proportion of invasiveness and lower Ki-67 index, 
      compared with the gsp-negative or low MEG3 expression group. In conclusion, gsp 
      oncogene may mediate MEG3 by promoting GH hypersecretion, resulting in smaller 
      tumors, as well as suppressing proliferation and invasiveness of GH-secreting 
      pituitary tumors.

TI  - TET2 and MEG3 promoter methylation is associated with acute myeloid leukemia in a 
      Hainan population.
PG  - 18337-18347
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.15440 [doi]
AB  - The promoter of MEG3, which encodes the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MEG3, is often 
      hypermethylated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Additionally, the Tet 
      methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 gene (TET2) is frequently inactivated, which can lead 
      to impaired DNA methylation and promote AML development. We examined the association 
      between TET2 and MEG3 promoter hypermethylation in Hainan patients with AML. The 
      expression of MEG3, TET2, miR-22-3p, and miR-22-5p was assessed in bone marrow 
      samples from AML patients and healthy controls using real-time quantitative PCR. 
      Using Sequenom MassARRAY technology, we compared MEG3 promoter methylation in AML 
      patients and healthy controls. MEG3 expression was lower in AML patients than in the 
      controls (P = 0.136). Moreover, there was greater methylation of MEG3 promoter in 
      the AML patients than the controls (P < 0.05). Methylation of the MEG3 promoter 
      correlated negatively with TET2 expression (P < 0.05, r < 0). Likewise there was a 
      negative correlation between TET2 activity and MEG3 promoter methylation (P < 0.05, 
      r < 0). These results suggest that hypermethylation of the MEG3 promoter in AML may 
      result from decreased TET2 activity. These data provide insight into the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying AML development and progression.

AB  - The functions of long noncoding (lnc)RNAs, such as MEG3, are defined by their 
      interactions with other RNAs and proteins. These interactions, in turn, are shaped 
      by their subcellular localization and temporal context. Therefore, it is important 
      to be able to analyze the relationships of lncRNAs while preserving cellular 
      architecture. The ability of MEG3 to suppress cell proliferation led to its 
      recognition as a tumor suppressor. MEG3 has been proposed to activate p53 by 
      disrupting the interaction of p53 with mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2). To test 
      this mechanism in the native cellular context, we employed two-color direct 
      stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, a single-molecule localization 
      microscopy technique, to detect and quantify the localizations of p53, Mdm2, and 
      MEG3 in U2OS cells. We developed a new cross-nearest neighbor/Monte Carlo algorithm 
      to quantify the association of these molecules. Proof of concept for our method was 
      obtained by examining the association between FKBP1A and mTOR, MEG3 and p53, and 
      Mdm2 and p53. In contrast to previous models, our data support a model in which MEG3 
      modulates p53 independently of the interaction with Mdm2.

AB  - BACKGROUND Dysregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in 
      periodontitis development. Nevertheless, the role and mechanism of lncRNA 
      maternally-expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in periodontitis progression remain unclear. This 
      study aimed to explore how and whether MEG3 affect viability, apoptosis, and 
      inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated periodontal ligament cells 
      (PDLCs). MATERIAL AND METHODS Periodontal ligament tissues were collected from 
      periodontitis patients or normal individuals. PDLCs were obtained from normal 
      periodontal ligament and treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS-induced PDLCs 
      injury was assessed via viability, apoptosis and inflammatory response using Cell 
      Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain 
      reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot. The levels of MEG3 
      and microRNA (miR)-143-3p were examined via quantitative reverse transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction. The protein kinase B(AKT)/inhibitory kappaB kinase (IKK) 
      pathway was analyzed via Western blot. The target correlation of MEG3 and miR-143-3p 
      was determined through dual-luciferase reporter analysis. RESULTS MEG3 level was 
      decreased and miR-143-3p level was upregulated in periodontitis and LPS-treated 
      PDLCs. MEG3 overexpression or miR-143-3p knockdown alleviated LPS-induced viability 
      inhibition, apoptosis promotion, and inflammatory response. MEG3 was a sponge for 
      miR-143-3p. miR-143-3p overexpression weakened the effect of MEG3 on LPS-induced 
      injury. MEG3 overexpression inhibited the activation of AKT/IKK pathway by sponging 
      miR-143-3p in LPS-treated PDLCs. CONCLUSIONS MEG3 overexpression inhibited 
      LPS-induced injury in PDLCs by inactivating the AKT/IKK pathway via sponging 
      miR-143-3p, providing a potential target for treatment of periodontitis.

LID - 10.1038/leu.2017.116 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, exemplified by 
      the recent finding that lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) inhibits tumor 
      growth in a p53-dependent manner. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common 
      malignant myeloid disorder in adults, and TP53 mutations or loss are frequently 
      detected in patients with therapy-related AML or AML with complex karyotype. Here, 
      we reveal that MEG3 is significantly downregulated in AML and suppresses 
      leukemogenesis not only in a p53-dependent, but also a p53-independent manner. In 
      addition, MEG3 is proven to be transcriptionally activated by Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1), 
      dysregulation of which by epigenetic silencing or mutations is causally involved in 
      AML. Therefore MEG3 is identified as a novel target of the WT1 molecule. Ten-eleven 
      translocation-2 (TET2) mutations frequently occur in AML and significantly promote 
      leukemogenesis of this disorder. In our study, TET2, acting as a cofactor of WT1, 
      increases MEG3 expression. Taken together, our work demonstrates that TET2 
      dysregulated WT1-MEG3 axis significantly promotes AML leukemogenesis, paving a new 
      avenue for diagnosis and treatment of AML patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a disease with high mortality. 
      Many so-called "junk" noncoding RNAs need to be discovered in PDAC. The purpose of 
      this study was therefore to investigate the function and regulatory mechanism of the 
      long noncoding RNA MEG3 in PDAC. METHODS: The Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO 
      database) was used to determine the differential expression of long noncoding RNAs 
      in PDAC, and MEG3 was selected for subsequent verification. Tissue and cell samples 
      were used to verify MEG3 expression, followed by functional detection in vitro and 
      in vivo. Microarrays were used to characterize long noncoding RNA and mRNA 
      expression profiles. Competing endogenous RNA analyses were used to detect 
      differential MEG3 and relational miRNA expression in PDAC. Finally, promoter 
      analyses were conducted to explain the downregulation of MEG3 PDAC. RESULTS: We 
      generated a catalogue of PDAC-associated long noncoding RNAs in the GEO database. 
      The ectopic expression of MEG3 inhibited PDAC growth and metastasis in vitro and in 
      vivo, which was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Microarray analysis showed 
      that multiple microRNAs interacted with MEG3. We also showed that MEG3, as a 
      competing endogenous RNA, directly sponged miR-374a-5p to regulate PTEN expression. 
      The transcription factor, Sp1, recruited EZH2 and HDAC3 to the promoter and 
      transcriptionally repressed MEG3 expression. Finally, clinical data showed that MEG3 
      and miR-374a-5p expressions were correlated with clinicopathological features. 
      Statistically, Sp1, EZH2, HDAC3, and miR-374a-5p were negatively correlated with 
      MEG3 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced MEG3 levels played a crucial role in the PDAC 
      malignant phenotype, which provided insight into novel and effective molecular 
      targets of MEG3 for pancreatic cancer treatment.

TI  - Long Noncoding RNA Meg3 Regulates Mafa Expression in Mouse Beta Cells by 
      Inactivating Rad21, Smc3 or Sin3α.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The main pathogenic mechanism of diabetes is a decrease in the 
      number of islet beta cells or a decline in their function. Recent studies have shown 
      that pancreatic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have a high degree of tissue 
      specificity and may be involved in the maintenance of islet cells function and the 
      development of diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular 
      regulatory mechanism of mouse maternal expressed gene 3 (Meg3) in insulin 
      biosynthesis in pancreatic islets. METHODS: Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and RNA 
      immunoprecipitation-qPCR were used to investigate the molecular mechanism of lncRNA 
      Meg3 in insulin biosynthesis by regulating v-Maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma 
      oncogene family, protein A (MafA), a mature beta cell marker in the MIN6 beta cell 
      line. Further, the expression levels of Meg3, Ezh2, MafA, Rad21, Smc3, and Sin3α 
      were analyzed in vivo and in vitro by RT-PCR and western blotting. RESULTS: 
      Intranuclear lncRNA Meg3 can bind EZH2, a methyltransferase belonging to the 
      Polycomb repressive complex-2, in pancreatic islet cells. In addition, knockdown of 
      Ezh2 can also inhibit the expression of MafA and Ins2, while expression levels of 
      Rad21, Smc3, and Sin3α are upregulated, by interfering with Ezh2 or Meg3 in 
      pancreatic beta cells. Knockdown of Meg3 resulted in the loss of EZH2 binding and 
      H3K27 trimethylation occupancy of Rad21, Smc3, and Sin3α promoter regions. The 
      inhibition of Rad21, Smc3, or Sin3α, which directly act on the MafA promoter, leads 
      to upregulated expression of MafA in both MIN6 cells and mouse islets. Moreover, the 
      synthesis and secretion of insulin were increased by inhibition of these 
      transcription factors. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic lncRNA Meg3 can epigenetically 
      regulate the expression of Rad21, Smc3, and Sin3α via EZH2-driven H3K27 methylation. 
      By inhibiting the expression of Rad21, Smc3, or Sin3α, Meg3 promotes the expression 
      of MafA and affects the production of insulin.

TI  - Long Noncoding RNA MEG3 Is an Epigenetic Determinant of Oncogenic Signaling in 
      Functional Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Cells.
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00278-17 [doi]
LID - e00278-17
AB  - The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MEG3 is significantly downregulated in pancreatic 
      neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). MEG3 loss corresponds with aberrant upregulation of 
      the oncogenic hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor c-MET in PNETs. Meg3 
      overexpression in a mouse insulin-secreting PNET cell line, MIN6, downregulates 
      c-Met expression. However, the molecular mechanism by which MEG3 regulates c-MET is 
      not known. Using chromatin isolation by RNA purification and sequencing (ChIRP-Seq), 
      we identified Meg3 binding to unique genomic regions in and around the c-Met gene. 
      In the absence of Meg3, these c-Met regions displayed distinctive enhancer-signature 
      histone modifications. Furthermore, Meg3 relied on functional enhancer of zeste 
      homolog 2 (EZH2), a component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), to inhibit 
      c-Met expression. Another mechanism of lncRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression 
      utilized triplex-forming GA-GT rich sequences. Transfection of such motifs from Meg3 
      RNA, termed triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs), in MIN6 cells suppressed c-Met 
      expression and enhanced cell proliferation, perhaps by modulating other targets. 
      This study comprehensively establishes epigenetic mechanisms underlying Meg3 control 
      of c-Met and the oncogenic consequences of Meg3 loss or c-Met gain. These findings 
      have clinical relevance for targeting c-MET in PNETs. There is also the potential 
      for pancreatic islet β-cell expansion through c-MET regulation to ameliorate β-cell 
      loss in diabetes.

TI  - Long non-coding RNA expression in bladder cancer.
PG  - 1205-1213
LID - 10.1007/s12551-017-0379-y [doi]
AB  - The advent of novel high-throughput sequencing methods has facilitated 
      identification of non-coding RNAs with fundamental roles in cellular biological and 
      pathological conditions. A group of these consisting of at least 200 nucleotides are 
      called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Their participation in the pathogenesis of 
      cancer has been highlighted in recent years. Bladder cancer, one of the most 
      prevalent cancers worldwide, exhibits altered expression levels of several lncRNAs. 
      Several in vitro and in vivo studies have assessed the effects of silencing RNAs on 
      cancer cell phenotypes and in vivo tumor growth. For instance, in vitro studies have 
      shown that nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), promoter of CDKN1A 
      antisense DNA damage-activated RNA(PANDAR) and metastasis-associated lung 
      adenocarcinoma transcript 1(MALAT1) have oncogenic effects while Maternally 
      expressed 3 (MEG3) and BRAF activated non-coding RNA (BANCR) are tumor suppressors. 
      Analysis of these data will help to identify a panel of lncRNAs that can be 
      potentially used for both early detection and prognosis in bladder cancer patients. 
      Here, we review the roles of several lncRNAs in the oncogenesis, tumor suppression, 
      early detection, and prognosis of bladder cancer.

TI  - LncRNA MEG3 downregulation mediated by DNMT3b contributes to nickel malignant 
      transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells via modulating PHLPP1 
      transcription and HIF-1α translation.
PG  - 3878-3889
LID - 10.1038/onc.2017.14 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key factors in various fundamental 
      cellular biological processes, and many of them are likely to have functional roles 
      in tumorigenesis. Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is an imprinted gene located at 
      14q32 that encodes a lncRNA, and the decreased MEG3 expression has been reported in 
      multiple cancer tissues. However, nothing is known about the alteration and role of 
      MEG3 in environmental carcinogen-induced lung tumorigenesis. Our present study, for 
      the first time to the best of our knowledge, discovered that environmental 
      carcinogen nickel exposure led to MEG3 downregulation, consequently initiating 
      c-Jun-mediated PHLPP1 transcriptional inhibition and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α 
      (HIF-1α) protein translation upregulation, in turn resulting in malignant 
      transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells. Mechanistically, MEG3 
      downregulation was attributed to nickel-induced promoter hypermethylation via 
      elevating DNMT3b expression, whereas PHLPP1 transcriptional inhibition was due to 
      the decreasing interaction of MEG3 with its inhibitory transcription factor c-Jun. 
      Moreover, HIF-1α protein translation was upregulated via activating the 
      Akt/p70S6K/S6 axis resultant from PHLPP1 inhibition in nickel responses. 
      Collectively, we uncover that nickel exposure results in DNMT3b induction and MEG3 
      promoter hypermethylation and expression inhibition, further reduces its binding to 
      c-Jun and in turn increasing c-Jun inhibition of PHLPP1 transcription, leading to 
      the Akt/p70S6K/S6 axis activation, and HIF-1α protein translation, as well as 
      malignant transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells. Our studies provide a 
      significant insight into understanding the alteration and role of MEG3 in 
      nickel-induced lung tumorigenesis.

AB  - Numerous studies have described the critical role played by microRNAs (miRNAs) in 
      cancer progression and the potential of these small non-coding RNAs for diagnostic 
      or therapeutic applications. However, the mechanisms responsible for the altered 
      expression of miRNAs in malignant cells remain poorly understood. Herein, via 
      epigenetic unmasking, we identified a group of miRNAs located in the imprinted delta 
      like non-canonical Notch ligand 1 (DLK1)-maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) locus that 
      were repressed in hepatic tumor cells. Notably, miR-493-5p epigenetic silencing was 
      correlated with hypermethylation of the MEG3 differentially regulated region (DMR) 
      in liver cancer cell lines and tumor tissues from patients. Experimental rescue of 
      miR-493-5p promoted an anti-cancer response by hindering hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) cell growth in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. We found that miR-493-5p 
      mediated part of its tumor-suppressor activity by abrogating overexpression of 
      insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and the IGF2-derived intronic oncomir miR-483-3p 
      in HCC cells characterized by IGF2 loss of imprinting (LOI). In summary, this study 
      describes an unknown miRNA-dependent regulatory mechanism between two distinct 
      imprinted loci and a possible therapeutic window for liver cancer patients 
      exhibiting IGF2-miR-483 LOI and amplification.

      proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis through AKT pathway.
PG  - 1010428317701311
LID - 10.1177/1010428317701311 [doi]
AB  - Long non-coding RNA MEG3 has been identified as a tumor suppressor which plays 
      important roles in tumorigenesis; however, its potential role in breast cancer has 
      not been fully examined. Here, we showed that MEG3 was downregulated in breast 
      cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of MEG3 inhibited breast cancer cell 
      proliferation and invasion, suggesting that MEG3 played an important role in breast 
      cancer progression and metastasis. Moreover, MEG3 upregulation caused marked 
      inhibition of angiogenesis-related factor expression. Conditioned medium derived 
      from MEG3 overexpressed breast cancer cells significantly decreased the capillary 
      tube formation of endothelial cells. Furthermore, elevated expression of MEG3 in 
      breast cancer inhibits in vivo tumorigenesis and angiogenesis in a nude mouse 
      xenograft model. Mechanistically, overexpression of MEG3 results in downregulation 
      of AKT signaling, which is pivotal for breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and 
      tumor angiogenesis. Collectively, these results suggest that MEG3 might suppress the 
      tumor growth and angiogenesis via AKT signaling pathway and MEG3 may serve as a 
      potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic target of breast cancer.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the utmost deadly human malignancies. This 
      type of cancer has been associated with several environmental, viral, and lifestyle 
      risk factors. Among the epigenetic factors which contribute in the pathogenesis of 
      HCC is dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). These transcripts modulate 
      expression of several tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes and alter the activity of 
      cancer-related signaling axes. Several lncRNAs such as NEAT1, MALAT1, ANRIL, and 
      SNHG1 have been up-regulated in HCC samples. On the other hand, a number of 
      so-called tumor suppressor lncRNAs namely CASS2 and MEG3 are down-regulated in HCC. 
      The interaction between lncRNAs and miRNAs regulate expression of a number of mRNA 
      coding genes which are involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. H19/miR-15b/CDC42, 
      H19/miR-326/TWIST1, NEAT1/miR-485/STAT3, MALAT1/miR-124-3p/Slug, 
      MALAT1/miR-195/EGFR, MALAT1/miR-22/SNAI1, and ANRIL/miR-144/PBX3 axes are among 
      functional axes in the pathobiology of HCC. Some genetic polymorphisms within 
      non-coding regions of the genome have been associated with risk of HCC in certain 
      populations. In the current paper, we describe the recent finding about the impact 
      of lncRNAs in HCC.

TI  - The Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in Female Oriented Cancers.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13236102 [doi]
LID - 6102
AB  - Recent advances in molecular biology have discovered the mysterious role of long 
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and targets 
      for advanced cancer therapy. Studies have shown that lncRNAs take part in the 
      incidence and development of cancers in humans. However, previously they were 
      considered as mere RNA noise or transcription byproducts lacking any biological 
      function. In this article, we present a summary of the progress on ascertaining the 
      biological functions of five lncRNAs (HOTAIR, NEAT1, H19, MALAT1, and MEG3) in 
      female-oriented cancers, including breast and gynecological cancers, with the 
      perspective of carcinogenesis, cancer proliferation, and metastasis. We provide the 
      current state of knowledge from the past five years of the literature to discuss the 
      clinical importance of such lncRNAs as therapeutic targets or early diagnostic 
      biomarkers. We reviewed the consequences, either oncogenic or tumor-suppressing 
      features, of their aberrant expression in female-oriented cancers. We tried to 
      explain the established mechanism by which they regulate cancer proliferation and 
      metastasis by competing with miRNAs and other mechanisms involved via regulating 
      genes and signaling pathways. In addition, we revealed the association between 
      stated lncRNAs and chemo-resistance or radio-resistance and their potential clinical 
      applications and future perspectives.

TI  - Long noncoding RNAs in osteosarcoma via various signaling pathways.
PG  - e23317
LID - 10.1002/jcla.23317 [doi]
LID - e23317
AB  - Osteosarcoma is one of the most commonly seen bone malignancies with high incidence 
      rate in both children and adults. Although the regulatory network of osteosarcoma 
      has been greatly concerned for years, the mechanisms regarding its oncogenesis and 
      development are still not clear. Recent discoveries have revealed that long 
      noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in the development, progression, and 
      invasion of osteosarcoma. Deregulated expression of lncRNAs has been found to 
      participate in the regulation of various signaling transduction pathways in 
      osteosarcoma. This review summarized roles of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis, 
      development, and potential therapeutic of osteosarcoma via different signaling 
      pathways. For examples, MALAT1, CCAT2, FER1L4, LOXL1-AS1, OIP5-AS1, PVT1, DBH-AS1, 
      and AWPPH regulate PI3K/Akt signaling; AWPPH and BE503655 regulate Wnt/β-catenin 
      signaling; NKILA and XIST regulate NF-κB signaling; MEG3 and SNHG12 regulate Notch 
      signaling; FOXD2-AS1 and LINK-A regulate HIF-1α signaling; GClnc1 and HOTAIR 
      regulate P53 signaling; ZFAS1, H19, and MALAT1 regulate MAPK, Hedgehog and Rac1/JNK 
      signaling, respectively.

TI  - Down-regulation of long non-coding RNA MEG3 promotes Schwann cell proliferation and 
      migration and repairs sciatic nerve injury in rats.
PG  - 7460-7469
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.15368 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral nerve injury and regeneration are complex processes and involve multiple 
      molecular and signalling components. However, the involvement of long non-coding RNA 
      (lncRNA) in this process is not fully clarified. In this study, we evaluated the 
      expression of the lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in rats after sciatic 
      nerve transection and explored its potential mechanisms. The expression of lncRNA 
      MEG3 was up-regulated following sciatic nerve injury and observed in Schwann cells 
      (SCs). The down-regulation of lncRNA MEG3 in SCs enhanced the proliferation and 
      migration of SCs via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. The silencing of lncRNA MEG3 
      promoted the migration of SCs and axon outgrowth in rats after sciatic nerve 
      transection and facilitated rat nerve regeneration and functional recovery. Our 
      findings indicated that lncRNA MEG3 may be involved in nerve injury and injured 
      nerve regeneration in rats with sciatic nerve defects by regulating the 
      proliferation and migration of SCs. This gene may provide a potential therapeutic 
      target for improving peripheral nerve injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Increasing evidence has demonstrated a significant role of long 
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in diverse biological processes, and many of which are 
      likely to have functional roles in vascular remodeling. However, their functions in 
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remain largely unknown. Pulmonary vascular 
      remodeling is an important pathological feature of PAH, leading to increased 
      vascular resistance and reduced compliance. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells 
      (PASMCs) dysfunction is involved in vascular remodeling. Long noncoding RNAs are 
      potential regulators of PASMCs function. Herein, we determined whether long 
      noncoding RNA-maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) was involved in PAH-related 
      vascular remodeling. METHODS: The arterial wall thickness was examined by 
      hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining in distal pulmonary arteries (PAs) isolated 
      from lungs of healthy volunteers and PAH patients. The expression level of MEG3 was 
      analyzed by qPCR. The effects of MEG3 on human PASMCs were assessed by cell counting 
      Kit-8 assay, BrdU incorporation assay, flow cytometry, scratch-wound assay, 
      immunofluorescence, and western blotting in human PASMCs. RESULTS: We revealed that 
      the expression of MEG3 was significantly downregulated in lung and PAs of patients 
      with PAH. MEG3 knockdown affected PASMCs proliferation and migration in vitro. 
      Moreover, inhibition of MEG3 regulated the cell cycle progression and made more 
      smooth muscle cells from the G0/G1 phase to the G2/M+S phase and the process could 
      stimulate the expression of PCNA, Cyclin A and Cyclin E. In addition, we found that 
      the p53 pathway was involved in MEG3-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study identified MEG3 as a critical regulator in PAH and 
      demonstrated the potential of gene therapy and drug development for treating PAH.

AB  - Glioma is the most common malignant central nervous system tumor with significant 
      mortality and morbidity. Despite considerable advances, the exact molecular pathways 
      involved in tumor progression are not fully elucidated, and patients commonly face a 
      poor prognosis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently drawn extra attention 
      for their potential roles in different types of cancer as well as non-malignant 
      diseases. More than 200 lncRNAs have been reported to be associated with glioma. We 
      aimed to assess the roles of the most investigated lncRNAs in different stages of 
      tumor progression and the mediating molecular pathways in addition to their clinical 
      applications. lncRNAs are involved in different stages of tumor formation, invasion, 
      and progression, including regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, tumor stemness, angiogenesis, the integrity of 
      the blood-tumor-brain barrier, tumor metabolism, and immunological responses. The 
      well-known oncogenic lncRNAs, which are upregulated in glioma, are H19, HOTAIR, 
      PVT1, UCA1, XIST, CRNDE, FOXD2-AS1, ANRIL, HOXA11-AS, TP73-AS1, and DANCR. On the 
      other hand, MEG3, GAS5, CCASC2, and TUSC7 are tumor suppressor lncRNAs, which are 
      downregulated. While most studies reported oncogenic effects for MALAT1, TUG1, and 
      NEAT1, there are some controversies regarding these lncRNAs. Expression levels of 
      lncRNAs can be associated with tumor grade, survival, treatment response 
      (chemotherapy drugs or radiotherapy), and overall prognosis. Moreover, circulatory 
      levels of lncRNAs, such as MALAT1, H19, HOTAIR, NEAT1, TUG1, GAS5, LINK-A, and 
      TUSC7, can provide non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic tools. Modulation of 
      expression of lncRNAs using antisense oligonucleotides can lead to novel 
      therapeutics. Notably, a profound understanding of the underlying molecular pathways 
      involved in the function of lncRNAs is required to develop novel therapeutic 
      targets. More investigations with large sample sizes and increased focus on in-vivo 
      models are required to expand our understanding of the potential roles and 
      application of lncRNAs in glioma.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) belong to an extremely heterogeneous class of 
      non-coding RNAs with a length ranging from 200 to 100,000 bp. They modulate a series 
      of cellular pathways in both physiological and pathological context. It is no 
      coincidence that they are expressed in an aberrant way in pathologies such as 
      cancer, so as to deserve to be subclassified as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. 
      These molecules are also involved in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation. 
      Several lncRNAs are able to modulate cell growth both positively and negatively, and 
      in this review we have focused on a small group of them, characterized by the 
      simultaneous action on different pathways regulating cell proliferation. They have 
      been considered in the light of their behavior in three different subtypes of 
      proliferative pathways that we can define as (I) tumor suppressor, (II) oncogenic 
      and (III) transcriptionally-driven. More specifically, we have characterized some 
      lncRNAs considered oncogenes (such as H19, linc-ROR, MALAT1, HULC, HOTAIR and 
      ANRIL), tumor suppressors (such as MEG3 and lincRNA-p21), and both oncogenes/tumor 
      suppressors (UCA1 and TUG1) in a little more detail. As can be understood from the 
      review, the interactions between lncRNAs and their molecular targets, only in the 
      context of controlling cell proliferation, give rise to an intricate molecular 
      network, the understanding of which, in the future, will certainly be of help for 
      the treatment of molecular diseases such as cancer.

AB  - The PI3K/AKT pathway is an intracellular signaling pathway with an indispensable 
      impact on cell cycle control. This pathway is functionally related with cell 
      proliferation, cell survival, metabolism, and quiescence. The crucial role of this 
      pathway in the development of cancer has offered this pathway as a target of novel 
      anti-cancer treatments. Recent researches have demonstrated the role of microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in controlling the PI3K/AKT pathway. Some 
      miRNAs such as miR-155-5p, miR-328-3p, miR-125b-5p, miR-126, miR-331-3p and miR-16 
      inactivate this pathway, while miR-182, miR-106a, miR-193, miR-214, miR-106b, 
      miR-93, miR-21 and miR-103/107 enhance activity of this pathway. Expression levels 
      of PI3K/AKT-associated miRNAs could be used to envisage the survival of cancer 
      patients. Numerous lncRNAs such as GAS5, FER1L4, LINC00628, PICART1, LOC101928316, 
      ADAMTS9-AS2, SLC25A5-AS1, MEG3, AB073614 and SNHG6 interplay with this pathway. 
      Identification of the impact of miRNAs and lncRNAs in the control of the activity of 
      PI3K/AKT pathway would enhance the efficacy of targeted therapies against this 
      pathway. Moreover, each of the mentioned miRNAs and lncRNAs could be used as a 
      putative therapeutic candidate for the interfering with the carcinogenesis. In the 
      current study, we review the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in controlling the PI3K/AKT 
      pathway and their contribution to carcinogenesis.

TI  - Exploring lncRNA-Mediated Regulatory Networks in Endometrial Cancer Cells and the 
      Tumor Microenvironment: Advances and Challenges.
LID - 10.3390/cancers11020234 [doi]
LID - 234
AB  - Recent studies have revealed both the promise and challenges of targeting long 
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to diagnose and treat endometrial cancer (EC). LncRNAs are 
      upregulated or downregulated in ECs compared to normal tissues and their 
      dysregulation has been linked to tumor grade, FIGO stage, the depth of myometrial 
      invasion, lymph node metastasis and patient survival. Tumor suppressive lncRNAs 
      (GAS5, MEG3, FER1L4 and LINC00672) and oncogenic lncRNAs (CCAT2, BANCR, NEAT1, 
      MALAT1, H19 and Linc-RoR) have been identified as upstream modulators or downstream 
      effectors of major signaling pathways influencing EC metastasis, including the 
      PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, WNT/β-catenin and p53 signaling pathways. TUG1 
      and TDRG1 stimulate the VEGF-A pathway. PCGEM1 is implicated in activating the 
      JAK/STAT3 pathway. Here, we present an overview of the expression pattern, 
      prognostic value, biological function of lncRNAs in EC cells and their roles within 
      the tumor microenvironment, focusing on the influence of lncRNAs on established 
      EC-relevant pathways. We also describe the emerging classification of EC subtypes 
      based on their lncRNA signature and discuss the clinical implications of lncRNAs as 
      valuable biomarkers for EC diagnosis and potential targets for EC treatment.

      Targets.
PG  - 1407-1419
LID - 10.1159/000479205 [doi]
AB  - Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents. 
      Although improvements in therapeutic strategies were achieved, the outcome remains 
      poor for most patients with metastatic or recurrent osteosarcoma. Therefore, it is 
      imperative to identify novel and effective prognostic biomarker and therapeutic 
      targets for the disease. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a novel class of RNA 
      molecules defined as transcripts >200 nucleotides that lack protein coding 
      potential. Many lncRNAs are deregulated in cancer and are important regulators for 
      malignancies. Nine lncRNAs (91H, BCAR4, FGFR3-AS1, HIF2PUT, HOTTIP, HULC, MALAT-1, 
      TUG1, UCA1) are upregulated and considered oncogenic for osteosarcoma. Loc285194 and 
      MEG3 are two lncRNAs downregulated and as tumor suppressor for the disease. 
      Moreover, the expressions of LINC00161 and ODRUL are associated with 
      chemo-resistance of osteosarcoma. The mechanisms for these lncRNAs in regulating 
      development of osteosarcoma are diverse, e.g. ceRNA, Wnt/β-catenin pathway, etc. The 
      lncRNAs identified may serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for 
      osteosarcoma.

AB  - CACX is one of the most common cancer affecting women world-wide. Here, expression 
      microarray analysis revealed 8 over-expressed transcribed pseudogenes (GBP1P1, 
      HLA-DRB6, HLA-H, SLC6A10P, NAPSB, KRT16P2, PTTG3P and RNF126P1), down-regulated 7 
      lincRNAs (H19, MIR100HG, MEG3, DIO3OS, HOXA11-AS, CD27-AS1 and EPB41L4A-AS) and 6 
      snoRNAs (SNORD97, SNORD3A, SNORD3C, SNORD3D, SNORA12 and SCARNA9) as DEncGs (log2 
      fold-change ≥ ±1.0) in CACX. Consequently, down-regulation of lincRNA MEG3 and 
      over-expression of pseudogenes, GBP1P1 and PTTG3P in the microarray analysis were 
      found concordant with the real-time quantitative PCR results upon validation. Then, 
      Ingenuity® Pathway analysis (IPA®) analysis with deregulated DEncGs identified 
      functionally important gene, H19. Further, validation (n = 52) of expression 
      confirmed frequent downregulation of H19 with significant association with its 
      deletion (LOH) and promoter methylation (n = 128) in CACX. Moreover, 
      clinicopathological analysis found Indian CACX patients (n = 26) with alterations of 
      H19 by deletion or, promoter methylation with concomitant low expression have poor 
      prognosis.

AB  - The development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex pathological process. 
      Long intergenic non-protein-coding RNA 1667 (LINC01667, also known as MGC38584) 
      plays an oncogenic role in several human cancers; however, its functional role in 
      HCC tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here, we first evaluated the gene expression 
      levels of LINC01667 in HCC using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene 
      Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. We then elucidated the 
      association between LINC01667 gene expression levels and the survival rates of 
      patients with HCC. We detected the effect of LINC01667 on the malignant phenotypes 
      (cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis etc.) and the MAPK and 
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways of HepG2, SMMC-7721 and HUH7 cells. We also 
      analyzed the sensitivity of HepG2, SMMC-7721 and HUH7 with different expression 
      levels of LINC01667 to anti-HCC drugs in vitro. Based on data from the 
      aforementioned databases and our experiments in vitro, we found that LINC01667 was 
      overexpressed in HCC, and that patients with high LINC01667 levels had a remarkably 
      poor overall survival rate. In addition, inhibition of LINC01667 expression 
      suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells 
      and promoted their apoptosis in vitro. In contrast, overexpression of LINC01667 
      promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of HUH7 cells and suppressed 
      their apoptosis in vitro. ChIRP-seq (chromatin isolation by RNA purification) showed 
      that LINC01667 bound to MEG3, and downregulated the expression of MEG3. In addition, 
      western blotting showed that LINC01667 could activate the NF-κB pathway to promote 
      cancer progression. In conclusion, we report that LINC01667 is an important oncogene 
      in HCC and may be used as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of HCC.

AB  - Transcription of the proto-oncogene SPHK1 is regulated by KHPS1, an antisense RNA 
      that activates SPHK1 expression by forming a triple-helical RNA-DNA-DNA structure at 
      the SPHK1 enhancer. Triplex-mediated tethering of KHPS1 to its target gene is 
      required for recruitment of E2F1 and p300 and transcription of the RNA derived from 
      the SPHK1 enhancer (eRNA-Sphk1). eRNA-Sphk1 evicts CTCF, which insulates the 
      enhancer from the SPHK1 promoter, thus facilitating SPHK1 expression. Genomic 
      deletion of the triplex-forming sequence attenuates SPHK1 expression, leading to 
      decreased cell migration and invasion. Replacement of the triplex-forming region 
      (TFR) of KHPS1 by the TFR of the lncRNA MEG3 tethers KHPS1 to the MEG3 target gene 
      TGFBR1, underscoring the interchangeability and anchoring function of sequences 
      involved in triplex formation. Altogether, the results reveal a triplex-driven 
      feedforward mechanism involving lncRNA-dependent induction of eRNA, which enhances 
      expression of specific target genes.

AB  - Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as integral components of 
      signaling pathways in various cancer types. In neuroblastoma, only a handful of 
      lincRNAs are known as upstream regulators or downstream effectors of oncogenes. 
      Here, we exploit RNA sequencing data of primary neuroblastoma tumors, neuroblast 
      precursor cells, neuroblastoma cell lines and various cellular perturbation model 
      systems to define the neuroblastoma lincRNome and map lincRNAs up- and downstream of 
      neuroblastoma driver genes MYCN, ALK and PHOX2B. Each of these driver genes controls 
      the expression of a particular subset of lincRNAs, several of which are associated 
      with poor survival and are differentially expressed in neuroblastoma tumors compared 
      to neuroblasts. By integrating RNA sequencing data from both primary tumor tissue 
      and cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that several of these lincRNAs are expressed 
      in stromal cells. Deconvolution of primary tumor gene expression data revealed a 
      strong association between stromal cell composition and driver gene status, 
      resulting in differential expression of these lincRNAs. We also explored lincRNAs 
      that putatively act upstream of neuroblastoma driver genes, either as presumed 
      modulators of driver gene activity, or as modulators of effectors regulating driver 
      gene expression. This analysis revealed strong associations between the 
      neuroblastoma lincRNAs MIAT and MEG3 and MYCN and PHOX2B activity or expression. 
      Together, our results provide a comprehensive catalogue of the neuroblastoma 
      lincRNome, highlighting lincRNAs up- and downstream of key neuroblastoma driver 
      genes. This catalogue forms a solid basis for further functional validation of 
      candidate neuroblastoma lincRNAs.

TI  - Doxorubicin-loaded iron oxide nanoparticles for glioblastoma therapy: a 
      combinational approach for enhanced delivery of nanoparticles.

AB  - Although doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anti-cancer drug with cytotoxicity in a 
      variety of different tumors, its effectiveness in treating glioblastoma multiforme 
      (GBM) is constrained by insufficient penetration across the blood-brain barrier 
      (BBB). In this study, biocompatible magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) 
      stabilized with trimethoxysilylpropyl-ethylenediamine triacetic acid (EDT) were 
      developed as a carrier of DOX for GBM chemotherapy. The DOX-loaded EDT-IONPs 
      (DOX-EDT-IONPs) released DOX within 4 days with the capability of an accelerated 
      release in acidic microenvironments. The DOX-loaded EDT-IONPs (DOX-EDT-IONPs) 
      demonstrated an efficient uptake in mouse brain-derived microvessel endothelial, 
      bEnd.3, Madin-Darby canine kidney transfected with multi-drug resistant protein 1 
      (MDCK-MDR1), and human U251 GBM cells. The DOX-EDT-IONPs could augment DOX's uptake 
      in U251 cells by 2.8-fold and significantly inhibited U251 cell proliferation. 
      Moreover, the DOX-EDT-IONPs were found to be effective in apoptotic-induced GBM cell 
      death (over 90%) within 48 h of treatment. Gene expression studies revealed a 
      significant downregulation of TOP II and Ku70, crucial enzymes for DNA repair and 
      replication, as well as MiR-155 oncogene, concomitant with an upregulation of 
      caspase 3 and tumor suppressors i.e., p53, MEG3 and GAS5, in U251 cells upon 
      treatment with DOX-EDT-IONPs. An in vitro MDCK-MDR1-GBM co-culture model was used to 
      assess the BBB permeability and anti-tumor activity of the DOX-EDT-IONPs and DOX 
      treatments. While DOX-EDT-IONP showed improved permeability of DOX across MDCK-MDR1 
      monolayers compared to DOX alone, cytotoxicity in U251 cells was similar in both 
      treatment groups. Using a cadherin binding peptide (ADTC5) to transiently open tight 
      junctions, in combination with an external magnetic field, significantly 
      enhanced both DOX-EDT-IONP permeability and cytotoxicity in the MDCK-MDR1-GBM 
      co-culture model. Therefore, the combination of magnetic enhanced convective 
      diffusion and the cadherin binding peptide for transiently opening the BBB tight 
      junctions are expected to enhance the efficacy of GBM chemotherapy using the 
      DOX-EDT-IONPs. In general, the developed approach enables the chemotherapeutic to 
      overcome both BBB and multidrug resistance (MDR) glioma cells while providing 
      site-specific magnetic targeting.

TI  - Pan-Cancer Analysis of lncRNA Regulation Supports Their Targeting of Cancer Genes in 
      Each Tumor Context.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are commonly dysregulated in tumors, but only a 
      handful are known to play pathophysiological roles in cancer. We inferred lncRNAs 
      that dysregulate cancer pathways, oncogenes, and tumor suppressors (cancer genes) by 
      modeling their effects on the activity of transcription factors, RNA-binding 
      proteins, and microRNAs in 5,185 TCGA tumors and 1,019 ENCODE assays. Our 
      predictions included hundreds of candidate onco- and tumor-suppressor lncRNAs 
      (cancer lncRNAs) whose somatic alterations account for the dysregulation of dozens 
      of cancer genes and pathways in each of 14 tumor contexts. To demonstrate proof of 
      concept, we showed that perturbations targeting OIP5-AS1 (an inferred tumor 
      suppressor) and TUG1 and WT1-AS (inferred onco-lncRNAs) dysregulated cancer genes 
      and altered proliferation of breast and gynecologic cancer cells. Our analysis 
      indicates that, although most lncRNAs are dysregulated in a tumor-specific manner, 
      some, including OIP5-AS1, TUG1, NEAT1, MEG3, and TSIX, synergistically dysregulate 
      cancer pathways in multiple tumor contexts.

TI  - Acupuncture regulates the autophagy of ovarian granulosa cells in polycystic ovarian 
      syndrome ovulation disorder by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway through LncMEG3.

AB  - The main features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are abnormal follicular 
      development and ovulation dysfunction, which are caused by the excessive autophagy 
      of ovarian granulosa cells. Acupuncture has been shown to improve ovulation 
      dysfunction and abnormal follicular development in PCOS patients, but its mechanism 
      is unclear. This study hypothesized that the beneficial effects of acupuncture are 
      the result of LncMEG3-mediated effects on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Acupuncture 
      (CV-4, RN-3, CV-6, SP-6 and EX-CA 1) was used to treat a rat model of polycystic 
      ovary syndrome. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe ovarian morphology 
      and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and 
      real-time PCR were used to detect LH, E2, FSH, T, AMH, LncMEG3, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, P62 
      and LC3II/I expression. The ovarian morphology of 90% of the rats in the acupuncture 
      treatment group was significantly improved after 11 consecutive days of therapy. 
      Acupuncture also resulted in a significant decrease in serum LH, FSH, T and AMH 
      levels and a significant increase in E2 level (P<0.01). LncMEG3, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, 
      P62 and LC3II/I expression was decreased in ovarian granulosa cells after 
      acupuncture compared with PCOS and lentiviral Intervention Group (P<0.05), while the 
      expression of follicle stimulating hormone receptor was increased (P<0.05). These 
      results indicate that acupuncture can down-regulate the expression of LncMEG3 and 
      thereby inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, reducing granulosa cell autophagy and 
      normalizing their proliferation. These factors ultimately remedy abnormal follicular 
      development. These findings suggest that acupuncture has clinical potential as a 
      safe treatment for PCOS ovulatory dysfunction.

AB  - Wilms' tumor (WT) is the most common type of childhood kidney cancer, and most cases 
      present with favorable histology and respond well to standard treatment. However, a 
      subset of patients with WT is diagnosed with bilateral, relapsed, and high-risk 
      tumors which remain the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Long 
      noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their aberrant expression have currently been 
      attracting great attention as oncogenes or tumor suppressors during tumor initiation 
      and progression. So far, their roles and related competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) 
      network remain unelucidated in nephroblastoma pathogenesis. We comprehensively 
      integrated lncRNA, microRNA (miRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles 
      from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatment 
      (TARGET) database and screened out differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs), lncRNAs 
      (DELs), and miRNAs (DEMis) to construct a ceRNA network based on the information 
      generated from miRcode, miRTarBase, TargetScan, and miRDB. Gene ontology (GO) and 
      Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were 
      performed to analyze the functional characteristics of DEMs in the ceRNA network. 
      The interaction between protein molecules was also analyzed by establishing a 
      protein-protein interaction network. Finally, prognosis-related biomarkers were 
      identified via survival analysis. Initially, 1647 DELs, 115 DEMis, and 3280 DEMs 
      (|log FC| > 2; FDR < 0.01) were obtained using the R package. Next, we constructed a 
      lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network (ceRNA network), in which 176 DELs, 24 DEMis, and 141 DEMs 
      were identified. Furthermore, 148 functional enrichment terms from GO were 
      identified and 29 KEGG pathways were found to be significantly enriched. We also 
      integrated patient clinical information to analyze the association between DERNAs 
      and patient prognosis. We found that high expression of 8 DELs (LINC00473, 
      AL445228.2, DENND5B-AS1, DLEU2, AC123595.1, AC135178.1, LINC00535, and LMO7-AS1) and 
      4 DEMs (CEP55, DEPDC1, PHF19, and TRIM36) correlated with poor survival in a patient 
      with WT, whereas high expression of 2 DELs (MEG3 and RMST), 1 DEM (KIAA0922), and 1 
      DEMi (hsa-mir-200a) could possibly lead to better clinical outcomes. For the first 
      time, the present study provided a novel insight into lncRNA-related ceRNA networks 
      and identified potential prognostic biomarkers in Wilms' tumor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last few years, accumulating evidence has indicated that numerous 
      long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abnormally expressed in gastric cancer (GC) and 
      are associated with the survival of GC patients. This study aimed to conduct a 
      meta-analysis on 19 lncRNAs (AFAP1 antisense RNA 1 [AFAP1-AS1], CDKN2B antisense RNA 
      1 [ANRIL], cancer susceptibility 15 [CASC15], colon cancer associated transcript 2 
      [CCAT2], gastric adenocarcinoma associated, positive CD44 regulator, long intergenic 
      noncoding RNA [GAPLINC], H19, imprinted maternally expressed transcript [H19], HOX 
      transcript antisense RNA [HOTAIR], HOXA distal transcript antisense RNA [HOTTIP], 
      long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 673 [LINC00673], metastasis-associated lung 
      adenocarcinoma transcript 1 [MALAT1], maternally expressed 3 [MEG3], promoter of 
      CDKN1A antisense DNA damage activated RNA [PANDAR], Pvt1 oncogene [PVT1], SOX2 
      overlapping transcript [Sox2ot], SPRY4 intronic transcript 1 [SPRY4-IT1], urothelial 
      cancer associated 1 [UCA1], X inactive specific transcript [XIST], ZEB1 antisense 
      RNA 1 [ZEB1-AS1] and ZNFX1 antisense RNA 1 [ZFAS1]) to systematically estimate their 
      prognostic value in GC. METHODS: The qualified literature was systematically 
      searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Database of Systematic 
      Reviews (up to March 16, 2018), and one meta-analysis relating to the relationship 
      between lncRNA expression and overall survival (OS) of GC patients was performed. 
      The only evaluation criterion of survival results was OS. RESULTS: A total of 6,095 
      GC patients and 19 lncRNAs from 51 articles were included in the present study. 
      Among the listed 19 lncRNAs, 18 lncRNAs (other than SPRY4-IT1) showed a 
      significantly prognostic value (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggested 
      that the abnormally expressed lncRNAs (AFAP1-AS1, ANRIL, CASC15, CCAT2, GAPLINC, 
      H19, HOTAIR, HOTTIP, LINC00673, MALAT1, MEG3, PANDAR, PVT1, Sox2ot, UCA1, XIST, 
      ZEB1-AS1 and ZFAS1) were significantly associated with the survival of GC patients, 
      among which AFAP1-AS1, CCAT2, LINC00673, PANDAR, PVT1, Sox2ot, ZEB1-AS1 and ZFAS1 
      were strong candidates in predicting the prognosis of GC patients.

TI  - Tunicamycin inhibits progression of glioma cells through downregulation of the 
      MEG-3-regulated wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

AB  - Glioma is derived from the oncogenic transformation of brain and spinal cord glial 
      cells, and is one of the most common primary brain tumors. Tunicamycin (TUN) can 
      significantly inhibit glioma growth and aggressiveness by promoting apoptosis in 
      glioma cells. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of TUN 
      on growth of glioma cells and examine the TUN-mediated signaling pathway. The 
      inhibitory effects of TUN on apoptosis, growth, aggressiveness and cell cycle arrest 
      of glioma tumor cells were determined by western blotting, reverse 
      transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, apoptotic assays and 
      immunofluorescence. The results demonstrated that treatment with TUN suppressed 
      growth, migration and invasion of glioma carcinoma cells. In addition, TUN treatment 
      induced apoptosis of glioma cells through downregulation of Bcl-2 and P53 expression 
      levels. Findings also indicated that TUN suppressed proliferation and arrested the 
      glioma cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. Further analysis of the mechanisms of 
      TUN demonstrated that TUN treatment upregulated the expression levels of maternally 
      expressed gene (MEG)-3, wnt and β-catenin in glioma cells. Furthermore, knockdown of 
      MEG-3 expression reversed the TUN-decreased wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which 
      subsequently also reversed the TUN-inhibited growth and aggressiveness of glioma 
      cells. In conclusion, the findings in the present study indicated that TUN treatment 
      inhibited growth and aggressiveness through MEG-3-mediated wnt/β-catenin signaling, 
      suggesting that TUN may be an efficient anticancer agent for the treatment of 
      glioma.

AB  - Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a highly prevalent cancer in AIDS patients, especially in 
      sub-Saharan Africa. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the 
      etiological agent of KS and other cancers like Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL). In 
      KS and PEL, all tumors harbor latent KSHV episomes and express latency-associated 
      viral proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs). The exact molecular mechanisms by which 
      latent KSHV drives tumorigenesis are not completely understood. Recent developments 
      have highlighted the importance of aberrant long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression 
      in cancer. Deregulation of lncRNAs by miRNAs is a newly described phenomenon. We 
      hypothesized that KSHV-encoded miRNAs deregulate human lncRNAs to drive 
      tumorigenesis. We performed lncRNA expression profiling of endothelial cells 
      infected with wt and miRNA-deleted KSHV and identified 126 lncRNAs as putative viral 
      miRNA targets. Here we show that KSHV deregulates host lncRNAs in both a 
      miRNA-dependent fashion by direct interaction and in a miRNA-independent fashion 
      through latency-associated proteins. Several lncRNAs that were previously implicated 
      in cancer, including MEG3, ANRIL and UCA1, are deregulated by KSHV. Our results also 
      demonstrate that KSHV-mediated UCA1 deregulation contributes to increased 
      proliferation and migration of endothelial cells.

TI  - MET/SMAD3/SNAIL circuit mediated by miR-323a-3p is involved in regulating 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition progression in bladder cancer.
PG  - e3010
LID - 10.1038/cddis.2017.331 [doi]
AB  - Bladder cancer (BCa) is the one of the most common cancers with high incidence, 
      occurrence and low 5-year survival rate. Emerging evidence indicates that DLK1-DIO3 
      genomic region especially the miRNA cluster in this region is involved in several 
      pathologic processes and various cancers, and miR-323a-3p is a member of this miRNA 
      cluster. In this study, we investigate the function and regulatory network of 
      miR-323a-3p in BCa. miR-323a-3p is frequently downregulated in BCa tissues and three 
      cell lines compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues and bladder normal cell line 
      (SV-HUC-1). Besides, downregulation of miR-323a-3p is significantly associated with 
      poor overall survival rate of BCa. Methylation of DLK1-MEG3 intergenic DMR (IG-DMR) 
      contributes to the reduction of miR-323a-3p. Overexpression of miR-323a-3p 
      significantly inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression of 
      BCa. Both upregulated MET and SMAD3 are direct targets of miR-323a-3p, and the 
      knockdown of MET and SMAD3 also represses the EMT progression consistently with 
      overexpression of miR-323a-3p. SNAIL is detected in the last targeted confocal 
      protein of both MET and SMAD3 signaling that trigger EMT consequently. Hence, a 
      miR-323a-3p/MET/SMAD3/SNAIL circuit is established to regulate the EMT progression 
      of BCa. And a mutual regulatory mechanism between miR-323a-3p/miR-433/miR-409 and 
      MET also participates in this circuit. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a novel 
      regulatory mechanism of the miR-323a-3p/MET/SMAD3/SNAIL circuit that is involved in 
      the EMT regulation of BCa, which may be a potential therapy target for BCa.

AB  - Background: There is increasing evidence that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are 
      involved in the process of carcinogenesis and treatment using chemotherapy. 
      Pterostilbene, a phytochemical agent with natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
      properties, has been shown to modulate oncogenic processes in many cancers. However, 
      there has been limited research on the association between pterostilbene and the 
      expression of lncRNAs. Methods: MCF7 breast cancer cells were treated with various 
      concentrations of pterostilbene and their gene expression profile was analyzed by 
      quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Results: 
      Treatment with pterostilbene inhibited cell proliferation and 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and increased cell apoptosis, autophagy 
      and ER stress. The Akt/mTOR pathway was downregulated, but p38 MAPK/Erk signaling 
      was activated in cells following treatment with pterostilbene. Pterostilbene 
      increased the expression of the lncRNAs MEG3, TUG1, H19, and DICER1-AS1 whereas the 
      expression of LINC01121, PTTG3P, and HOTAIR declined. Knockdown of lncRNA H19 
      resulted in a reduction of the cell invasion, with the cells becoming more sensitive 
      to pterostilbene therapy. Conclusions: These results suggest that efficient optimum 
      disruption of lncRNA expression might possibly improve the anti-tumor effects of 
      phytochemical agents, thus serving as a potential therapy for breast cancer.

TI  - Differential expression of efferocytosis and phagocytosis associated genes in tumor 
      associated macrophages exposed to African American patient derived prostate cancer 
      microenvironment.
PG  - 22-27
LID - 10.5430/jst.v9n2p22 [doi]
AB  - Macrophages are the first line of defense in the cellular environment in response to 
      any antigenic or foreign invasion. Since cancer cells express antigenic molecules 
      and create a tumor microenvironment quite different from the normal cellular 
      environment, macrophages will attack this cancer cells as foreign Invaders. However, 
      the cancer cells adept their ability to suppress macrophage activity by secreting 
      compounds/proteins through unknown mechanisms and train these macrophages to aid in 
      tumorigenesis. These macrophages are commonly known as tumor associated macrophages 
      (TAM). In this study, our goal was to find out key regulatory molecules involved in 
      this conversion of cancer-fighting macrophages to cancer friendly macrophages. We 
      used African American(AA) patient derived established human prostate cancer cells 
      along with the human derived macrophages followed by Affymetrix cDNA microarray 
      analysis. Microarray analysis of the PCa cell exposed macrophages revealed 
      appreciable decrease in mRNA expression of several genes associated with 
      phagocytosis process. Aberrant expression of several noncoding RNAs that control the 
      expression of such phagocytosis associated molecules were also evident. Increased 
      expression of oncogenic miR such as, miR-148, 615, 515, 130, 139 and markedly 
      decreased expression of tumor suppressive miR's MiR-3130, let7c,101,103, 383 were 
      noted. Further, TARGET SCAN analysis demonstrated these differential expression of 
      non-coding RNA's causing down regulation of phagocytosis promoting genes elf5A, 
      Meg3, Tubb5, Sparcl-1, Uch-1, Bsg(CD147), Ube2v, GULP, Stabilin 1 and Pamr1. There 
      is an increase of RAP1GAP gene that causes concomitant decrease in the expression of 
      tubulin genes that promote cytoskeletal assembly in forming phagosomes. In addition 
      Ingenuity pathway analysis of the gene expression data also showed upregulation of 
      antiphagocytic genes IL-10, CD 16, IL-18 and MMP-9. Some core canonical pathways 
      showing physiology of cellular signaling obtained by data analyzed by the Ingenuity 
      software is confirmed a very complex mechanism still to be deciphered involved in 
      the biology of TAM formation by which the rogue cancer cells tame their enemies, the 
      macrophages and actually make them their helper cells to survive and propagate in 
      the tumor microenvironment and thus prepare for epithelial mesenchymal transition 
      for future metastasis and cancer stem cell formation and progression.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs 
      (circRNAs) involve in germ cell development. However, little is known about the 
      functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs and circRNAs in self-renewal and differentiation 
      of germline stem cells. Therefore, we explored the expression profiles of mRNAs, 
      lncRNAs, and circRNAs in male and female mouse germline stem cells by 
      high-throughput sequencing. We identified 18573 novel lncRNAs and 18822 circRNAs in 
      the germline stem cells and further confirmed the existence of these lncRNAs and 
      circRNAs by RT-PCR. The results showed that male and female germline stem cells had 
      similar GDNF signaling mechanism. Subsequently, 8115 mRNAs, 3996 lncRNAs, and 921 
      circRNAs exhibited sex-biased expression that may be associated with germline stem 
      cell acquisition of the sex-specific properties required for differentiation into 
      gametes. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed different 
      functions for these sex-biased lncRNAs and circRNAs. We further constructed 
      correlated expression networks including coding-noncoding co-expression and 
      competing endogenous RNAs with bioinformatics. Co-expression analysis showed 
      hundreds of lncRNAs were correlated with sex differences in mouse germline stem 
      cells, including lncRNA Gm11851, lncRNA Gm12840, lncRNA 4930405O22Rik, and lncRNA 
      Atp10d. CeRNA network inferred that lncRNA Meg3 and cirRNA Igf1r could bind 
      competitively with miRNA-15a-5p increasing target gene Inha, Acsl3, Kif21b, and 
      Igfbp2 expressions. These findings provide novel perspectives on lncRNAs and 
      circRNAs and lay a foundation for future research into the regulating mechanisms of 
      lncRNAs and circRNAs in germline stem cells.
